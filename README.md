# Batch and Layer Normalization for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview

This project implements Batch and Layer Normalization techniques in Python to enhance the training of a Multi-Layered Perceptron for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Visualize MNIST images.
- Train models with different normalization techniques and hyperparameters, and visualize the results.
- Display results from pre-trained models.

## Setup and Run

1. Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed.
2. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
